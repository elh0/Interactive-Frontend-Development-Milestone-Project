# Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project

This project was developed from the brief enlisted by Code Institute. I created a flip card memory game, using CI staff members as the playing cards.

The objective of the game is to sucessfully **match all 12 cards**

Within this project I have used everything I learned thus far from Code Institue.
This project will utilise my experience of **HTML5**, **CSS3** & **JS**.

## UX

The user is guided fluidly to operate the game through the header & footer elements. This is common practice for users to find more information about the webpage so these are natural interactions therefore creating a familar feeling. I was intent on using enough negative space for the user to focus on the game in practice & leave no distracting/unecessary elements on the webpage.

The JavaScript code also has an application of UX using objects & arrays such as ```setTimeout``` & ```lockBoard```. These were created with intention of helping the user stay within the parameters of the games intended functionality. ```setTimeout``` provides a slight delay when cards aren't correctly matched, whilst ```lockBoard``` prevents user from selecting multiple cards on the canvas.
